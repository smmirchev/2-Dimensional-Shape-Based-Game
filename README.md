## 2-Dimensional-Shape-Based-Game

The program is an originally designed game. The game is a maze in which the player has to find and step on the blue circle to win. There are red pie-shaped enemies which fly over the maze, when they collide with the player, the game is lost. The player can collect pink squares inside the maze which will reward the player with 10 scores. At the end of the game the player can enter their name and record the score or simply check their top 10 highest scores.

On the image above, the player is the green circle, the yellow squares are the maze walls, the red pie shapes are the enemies, the pink squares give 10 points each, the blue circle is the goal. The player can move with the arrow keys. The player will lose the game if they touch an enemy, get 10 points if they step on pink square, win the game if they step on the blue circle. The player cannot cross over yellow squares, as they are the maze walls.
